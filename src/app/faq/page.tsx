              <h2>What determines how fast my PERM case gets processed?</h2>
              <p>Two main factors:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Employer Name Initial:</strong> Has the most significant impact (about 80%). 
                  Companies with earlier alphabet initials are generally processed faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Submission Date:</strong> Has a minor effect (about 20%). The exact date you 
                  submit within a month can slightly influence your wait time.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>How accurate are these timeline estimates?</h2>
              <p>
                Our predictions incorporate recent processing data and statistical methods. While they typically 
                reflect real-world results with around 80% confidence, they&apos;re estimationsâ€”not guarantees. 
                Processing times can vary based on unforeseen factors at the DOL.

              <h2>Where does permupdate.com obtain its data?</h2>
              <p>
                We primarily use publicly available data provided by the U.S. Department of Labor 
                (<a 
                  href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance"

                </a>). 
                Additionally, we manually gather daily updates from other publicly accessible websites to enhance 
                accuracy and timeliness.

              <h2>Can I rely solely on permupdate.com&apos;s predictions?</h2>
              <p>
                No. Predictions provided by permupdate.com are purely informational. While we strive for accuracy, 
                we are not a legal entity, and our information should not be used as definitive guidance or legal
